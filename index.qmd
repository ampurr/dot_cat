## What?

Hello! Welcome to joss dot cat, a small website focused on cat facts that I enjoy thinking about. I also have links and references to other places to learn about cats. I'm still learning and there's a lot I don't know. I welcome comments and criticism.


## Why?

Cats are the best and coolest animals currently alive today.^["Cat" refers to any animal in the Felidae family.] I like thinking about them and looking at them. This website makes me happy and hopefully makes you happy, too.


## Cat Facts

### Housecat Facts

Facts about _Felis catus_, the common housecat and the animal that most people thing of when they see the word "cat".

### Amur Tiger Facts

Facts about a group of animals within _Panthera tigris altaica_. Amur tigers are highly endangered.


## Cat Resources

### Science

- The [Cat Specialist Group](http://www.catsg.org/) is a collective of cat specialists who work with endangered cats.

### Art

- [catcrumb](https://catcrumb.tumblr.com/) is an archive of cats drawn daily. Most of the drawings were done in MS Paint. I like them.
