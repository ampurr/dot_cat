## Why?

Cats are the best and coolest animals currently alive today.^["Cat" refers to any animal in the Felidae family.] I like thinking about them and looking at them. This website makes me happy and hopefully makes you, internet stranger, happy too.

Do you have a cat fact to share (and a source to verify that fact)? Do you just wanna send me pics of your cat? A pic of a cat on the street? Did you have a dream about being eaten by a lion and want someone to know? Literally anything about any animal in the Felidae family? Please email me at `czdzw3c6@duck.com`.


## What?

This website contains cat facts that I enjoy thinking about. It also refers you to other cat-related websites and books and the like.
