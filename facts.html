			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Here are some of my favorite cat facts. I hope you like them, too. Unfortunately, not all these facts are fun for the cat, but I think all of them are interesting.
			<p>My main source for cat facts is John Bradshaw&rsquo;s books: <cite>Cat Sense</cite> and <cite>The Behaviour of the Domestic Cat</cite>. But I reference some other works as well.
